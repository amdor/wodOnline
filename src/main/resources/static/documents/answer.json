Tell me what's in the air!\n-Louder! They don't hear you yet........eh, the council. The wizard council turns out to be more or less warlock council? I don't know these ranks, types, categories, but one for sure. They found an ancient scroll of some sort. They want to bring back to life something, a beast that should never ever again roam these lands. Pack up and run, they cannot be stopped now.\n-Thank you. Once again, I owe you.\n-You bet!
